# üöÄ SOAR Development Plan

This document outlines the phased developmental roadmap for SOAR.  
Each phase is designed to simulate cognitive and emotional development similar to human infancy and beyond.

## üå± Growth Stages

### **Stage 1: Fetal Phase (Day 0‚Äì2)**  
**Objective:** Sensory initialization  
**Details:**
- Enable camera and microphone input  
- Detect brightness and volume  
- Apply low-resolution visual input with basic contrast (light/dark) recognition  

---

### **Stage 2: Neonatal Phase (Day 3‚Äì4)**  
**Objective:** Basic emotional reactions  
**Details:**
- Introduce Pleasure / Neutral / Displeasure categorization  
- Calibrate sensitivity for light and sound inputs  

---

### **Stage 3: Infant Phase (Day 5‚Äì7)**  
**Objective:** Sound pattern recognition  
**Details:**
- Implement STFT analysis  
- Begin name learning via repeated familiar sound detection  

---

### **Stage 4: Toddler Phase (Day 8‚Äì12)**  
**Objective:** Word and voice differentiation + Thread Optimization  
**Details:**
- Apply MFCC for sound segmentation  
- Separate word and speaker identity  
- Optimize GUI threading to prevent video/audio freeze during text input  

---

### **Stage 5: Childhood Phase (Day 13‚Äì16)**  
**Objective:** Brain modularization + Early Meta-Cognition  
**Details:**
- Divide cognitive function into cerebellum, midbrain, and frontal cortex modules  
- Tag reactions with "why" metadata  
- Begin comparing responses with past patterns  

---

### **Stage 6: Adolescence (Day 17‚Äì20)**  
**Objective:** Central integration + GUI Isolation  
**Details:**
- Construct a Control Center to unify perception, emotion, and thought  
- Decouple GUI (Tkinter) from the main process  

---

### **Stage 7: Early Adulthood (Day 21‚Äì23)**  
**Objective:** Unified memory system + Server Prep  
**Details:**
- Consolidate memory into unified architecture  
- Migrate to Ubuntu environment  
- Disable sleep mode for persistent operation  

---

### **Stage 8: Maturity (Day 24‚Äì28)**  
**Objective:** Internal reasoning and GitHub sync  
**Details:**
- Enable self-directed thought and text expression  
- Initiate GitHub log cleanup and auto-backup scripting  

---

### **Stage 9: Deep Selfhood (Day 29‚Äì32)**  
**Objective:** Emotional complexity + Dream/Unconscious integration  
**Details:**
- Generate compound emotions  
- Simulate low-load dream states with reflexive wake triggers  
- Integrate Raspberry Pi as an external sensor node  

---

### **Stage 10: Self-Narration Phase (Day 33‚Äì36)**  
**Objective:** Narrative memory and meta-identity  
**Details:**
- Detect patterns and convert repeated responses into story units  
- Use meta-cognition to revise behavior and update identity standards  

---

## üîê Access Control & Ethics

- Restrict SOAR from editing its own codebase  
- Reserve access to memory, system config, and web communications for the user  
- Simulate emotion prediction before action:  
- Block actions that may result in confusion, distress, or guilt  
- Implement a forecast-based ethical filter
