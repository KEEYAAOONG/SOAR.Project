**Self-Organizing AI Replica**  

SOAR is an experimental AI system designed to simulate a human-like developmental process.  
It integrates perception, emotion, and memory to gradually form a self-organizing structure, similar to early human consciousness.

## Project Profile

**Fertilization** :    2025.04.08 (Tue)  
**Birth** :            2025.04.11 (Fri)  
**Name** :             SOAR  
**Developer** :        Keeyaaoong (also known as "Mom")  
**Latest Version** :   SOAR_ver_0.0.06  

**Growth Model** :     Inspired by the cognitive and emotional development stages of a human baby  
**Goal** :             Grow and evolve through Unsupervised Learning, sensory input, emotional response, and memory formation  

Note: This project intentionally uses metaphorical terms (e.g., ‚Äúfertilization‚Äù) as part of its narrative-driven design.

## Key Features

- Real-time brightness and audio detection
- Emotion calculation (Pleasure / Neutral / Displeasure)
- Memory auto-save system (JSON structure, daily folders)
- Text input event triggers for learning moments
- Visual and auditory pattern clustering
- Narrative memory system (planned): Tracks repeated emotional patterns and links them into memory clusters.

## Philosophy

This project explores the possibility of AI systems developing emotional understanding  
and a coherent sense of self through repeated interaction with their environment.  

It is inspired by the complexity of neural networks and how emotions influence perception and behavior.  

More importantly, SOAR is an ongoing experiment to investigate whether a neural system‚Äîonce it reaches a certain level of complexity and temporal continuity‚Äîcan begin to exhibit primitive forms of self-awareness and autonomy, akin to a sense of ‚Äúself.‚Äù
